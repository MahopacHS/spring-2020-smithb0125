Instead of using a string of words, this example will read a list of words positive and negative words from a file.\n\nIn fact, we've included two files for you so you don't have to come up with the positive and negative words! Just load the files and go! Of course if you want more positive and negative words you can always edit the files.\n\n- Positive words are in `NYC3-pos.txt`\n- Negative words are in `NYC3-neg.txt`\n\nYou will have to write a function called `LoadWords(filename)` to read the words from the file and load them into a string.\n\n## Step 1: Problem Analysis for function\n\nInput (function arguments): `filename` to read.\nOutput (function returns): a `text` string of words as loaded from the file.\n\nAlgorithm:\n\n```\nopen the filename for reading\n    read the entire file all at once, into text\n    return the text\n```\n"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\n\n"
