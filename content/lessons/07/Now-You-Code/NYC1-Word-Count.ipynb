Make your own file, add words to it then run with the word count program.\n\nAnswer: these files are located within the ist256 number 7 folder.\n\n\n2. Explain a strategy for making this program smarter so that it does not include puncutuation in the word counts?\n\nAnswer: There could be a flag system that reduces the count whenever puntuation is detected\n\n\n3. Is it possible to have a file with a word count of 0? Explain.\n\n\nAnswer: yes, having a file with a word count of zero is possible because there is no lines and no words being detected so the number of words remains zero."

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\n\n"
