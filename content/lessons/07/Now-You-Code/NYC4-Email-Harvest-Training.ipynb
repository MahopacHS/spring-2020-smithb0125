The most common being buiding a list of emails for spamming... er, I meant \"mass marketing.\" \n\nThe best way to find the emails in the mailbox file is to search for lines in the file that begin with \"From: (similar to what we did in the lab). When you find an email write just the email address (not \"From:\" and the address) to \"NYC4-emails.txt\", and don't worry about duplicates.\n\nThe program should print the number of emails it wrote to the file.\n\nExample Run:\n\n```\nWrote 27 emails to NYC4-emails.txt\n```"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\n\n"
