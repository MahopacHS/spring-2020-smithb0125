The process is simple.\n\n\n### One-Time Setup: Creating Your Ok Account\n\nFirst, sign up for the service using your Syracuse University Google account. To learn how to setup your SU Google acccount, visit https://ols.syr.edu/google-account-for-syracuse-university/\n\n1. Once you have your SU Google account, visit https://okpy.org and click the **Student Login** button.\n2. Login with `netid@g.syr.edu` where `netid` is your SU NetID. Do not use your personal google account. If you are logged in with your personal account, select the **Use another account** option.\n\n### Submission Process for Every Homework and Lab\n\nThe submission process is the same for every Homework and Lab:\n\nThere will be Python code at the top of the notebook file. Runing it will generate a link and provide an access code to connect your notebook to the Ok Assignment. \n\nTry This now, by running this cell. To run the cell, click on it then click the `>| Run` button in the toolbar."

Answer the questions by double clicking on the question and placing your answer next to the Answer: prompt.\n\n\n1. Record any questions you have about this lab that you would like to ask in recitation. It is expected you will have questions if you did not complete the code sections correctly.  Learning how to articulate what you do not understand is an important skill of critical thinking. \n\nAnswer: I have some questions about what causes spaces between words when printing. \n\n2. What was the most difficult aspect of completing this lab? Least difficult?  \n\nAnswer: The most difficult aspect of completing this lab was setting up 1.4. The least difficult aspect of this lab was the first lesson.\n\n3. What aspects of this lab do you find most valuable? Least valuable?\n\nAnswer: I find every aspect of this lab valuble because I was able to learn new things.\n\n4. Rate your comfort level with this week's material so far.   \n\n1 ==> I can do this on my own and explain how to do it.   \n2 ==> I can do this on my own without any help.   \n3 ==> I can do this with help or guidance from others. If you choose this level please list those who helped you.   \n4 ==> I don't understand this at all yet and need extra help. If you choose this please try to articulate that which you do not understand.   \n\nAnswer: 3, I did this with assistance with my teacher and one of my friends for support. I have a feeling that I can correctly do the material now but I would need a peer to review my code.\n\n"
