Here's how it should work:\n\nExample Run 1:\n\n```\nEnter Tweet: You got a 50 on the exam? #iamsad for you!\nHashtag: #iamsad\n```    \nExample Run 2:\n\n```\nEnter Tweet: #lol too funny #joke #haha\nHashtag: #lol\nHashtag: #joke\nHashtag: #haha\n```\n\nExample Run 3:\n\n```\nEnter Tweet: Happy birthday @mafudge\nHashtag: none\n```\n\nYour approach should be to split the text into words and for each word look for the hashtag `#` at the start of the word."

Is this a problem?\n\nAnswer: when the hashtag is not in the beginning of the word it doesn't detect it as a hashtag. this is only a problem if a hastag has another hashtag in it.\n\n\n2. Describe an approach for refactoring this code to use a function? What would the arguments and return values be? (Don't refactor the code, just describe your approach!)\n\nAnswer: refactoring the code to use a function would include using the return values for the hastags.\n\n\n3. Is there a way to write this program without a loop?\n\n\nAnswer: no\n"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\n\n"
