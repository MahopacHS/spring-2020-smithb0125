Is this an error?\n\nAnswer:  This is not an error, because negative numbers still exist\n\n\n2. Would it be difficult to write a program which did the opposite (conversion F to C)? Explain.\n\nAnswer:   It wouldn't be that difficult, it would just be rewriting conversion formula backwards.\n\n3. Did you store the conversion in a variable before printing it on the last line? I argue this makes your program easier to understand. Why? \n\nAnswer:   This makes the program easier to understand because it reduces the amount of code used\n\n\n"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\nThe main struggle i had with this program was trying to make it function, i had an unexplainable syntax error which was fixed by deleting and retyping all my code.\n"
