What happens when you enter `TWO` instead of `2` for the number of people dining? or $60 as the amount of the check, instead of 60?\n\nAnswer:   The computer program can't understand it because it is not a number.\n\n\n2. What type of error is this? Do you think it can be handled in code?\n\nAnswer:   This is a syntax error, it can't be handled, must be replaced.\n\n\n3. Explain what happens when you enter `0.5` for the number of people dining? Does the program run? Does it make sense? \n\nAnswer:   when 0.5 is entered the program runs but it does not make sense, it is a logic error.\n\n\n"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\nI need to work more on remembering what code inputs, types, and precentages are able to do.\n"
